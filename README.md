# Titule : Internet Security Recommendation for Governments , Institutions/Companies and Individual Operating on Democractic Countries.


note: I am not expert on security , nor work on this sector but I wan to create a document
where different people can share theirs personal recomendation for security after the resent hack from North Korea
ditadorship goverment  to Sony .. This document will be able to be edite by other people 
that want to add more recomendation.  This document will be consider copyleft material ..
It can be copy, modified and distributed with not restritions. I personally I hate the idea 
of additional regulation on any sector because to many regulation can be detriment to the 
industry but I believe not regulation at all will be worst. 

## Internet Security Iniciative :

  What law and regulation  need to be implemented around all democratic nation to improve 
security around the Internet? What procedure companies and institutions can fallow to increase
security ? What we can do like individual to increase security on the internet and our personal
network?

  Each idea or section will need to be analyze in three angle from Country law and regulation, Institutions/companies/organizations and Individual. The document need to include ideas how to protect privacity to this three area where is understood :
  
  Form of Privacity:
  
   - Goverment ==> Secret of States with limitations: under democratic form of goverment where what is considered Secret of state is limited and individual privacy law that protect the people working/or not for goverment.
   
   - Institutions/companies/organizations ==> Trade Secret with restriction relate to monopoly and privacy right derived from person privacy laws (in United States a corporation as the same rights as natural persons, some of the legal right of corporation and other type of organization are derive from right provide to the people by the constitution). Undermined individual privacy rights will undermined corporation privacy right. 
   
   - Individuals ==> Personal Privacy.

  I make this distention becasue In reference of individual and some Goverments that don't like or attack the idea of Privacity and they normally make reference that people don't have nothing to hide if there not doing nothing wrong but privacity apply to Govemnet(secret of states,etc) and Institutions/companies/organizations (traded secret,etc).  Persons or Organizations/Goverments that said that we don't need Privacity or try to convince us to live under society with less privacy right , They implied too that goverment don't need Secret of States and Companies don't need Traded Secret or any other derived right from constitutional right provide to the people. 
  
Dilema of security : (this some ideas that need to work in future edition of this document)  

Uncertainty Principle apply to bid data (personal hypothesis) : The more data we aquired there is a threshold where additional data will produce more noise/error/false leads or reduce the chance to get/proccess usefull information , in other word we get overwhelmed by it. 

Uncertainty Principle: "it states that the more precisely the position of some particle is determined, the less precisely its momentum can be known, and vice versa." The idea that it maybe apply to big data maybe get a better understanding of physics(maybe there is a relation between them) . This idea occurs to me when thinking about processing of visual data and the need to forget part of the data to be able to get better result.
